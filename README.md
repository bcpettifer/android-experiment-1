Simple android experiments

Inspired by the Novoda booth at #DroidconUK15 this is some improvements on the demo "test" that I created for the competition.

Circling Madness is inspired by the optical illusion created when concentric circles are offset slightly from the centre and then animated to rotate around the centre point.
